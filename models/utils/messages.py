==================================================
    üß†  PD Multi-Modal Prediction Pipeline  üß†
==================================================

Welcome to the **PD-MultiModal-Prediction** framework!

This pipeline is designed to predict **Parkinson‚Äôs Disease (PD) progression** by integrating multimodal data‚Äîincluding clinical scores, imaging metrics, and biomarkers. It combines classical regression techniques with **uncertainty quantification** and **explainability** to help researchers and clinicians better understand model decisions and performance.

Whether you're analyzing important features with SHAP, estimating prediction confidence via NGBoost, or conducting feature ablation studies‚Äîthis framework has you covered!

üîß Modules Included:
--------------------------------------------------
1Ô∏è‚É£  Data Integration & Preprocessing  
    - Handles multimodal tabular data  
    - Ensures reproducibility with standard pipelines  

2Ô∏è‚É£  Regression Models  
    - Linear Regression, Random Forests, and NGBoost  
    - NGBoost includes NIG uncertainty modeling and regularization  

3Ô∏è‚É£  Explainability & Feature Importance  
    - SHAP-based visualizations for transparency  
    - Insights into model decisions  

4Ô∏è‚É£  Feature Ablation  
    - Systematically removes features  
    - Evaluates performance drops to gauge feature relevance  

5Ô∏è‚É£  Evaluation Pipelines  
    - Supports nested/sequential cross-validation  
    - Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV or Ray  

üì§ Output:  
    - Prediction scores with uncertainty intervals  
    - SHAP plots and feature rankings  
    - Logs from ablation studies  

üìò Tools Used:
- scikit-learn  
- SHAP  
- NGBoost with custom distributions  
- Ray (for scalable hyperparameter tuning)
